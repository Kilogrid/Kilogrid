 * @mainpage Kilogrid Library API
 * @brief    Library for the Kilogrid virtualization environment for the 
 * Kilobot robotic platform.
 * 
 * The API provides all the function required to perform experiments with
 * the Kilogrid virtualization environment and the Kilobot robots.
 * 
 * The API includes:
 * 		- main programs for each devices (dispatcher, modules, kilobots)
 * 		- initialization functions for each devices which initialize hardware
 * 		and firmware
 * 		- bi-directionnal communication function via:
 * 			- infrared between module and kilobot
 * 			- CAN interface between all the modules and the dispatcher
 * 			- USB between the dispatcher and the KiloGUI
 * 			- serial for debugging specific devices
 * 		- device-specific sensor and actuator control (LEDs, IR, Motor, etc...)
 * 		- library of behavior for the kilobot for example position tracking
 * 		- experiment templates
 * 		
 * The API is divided in subfolder per device with a common folder for shared
 * functions. See file list on the left side for list of all documented source.
 * 
 * This is the high-level documented API destined for experimenter 
 * providing description and example of functions to experiment swarm robotics.
 * \n It does not includes documentation of low-level components. If 
 * information is missing in this documentation we recommand to search in the 
 * documented source of the project, or raise an issue on the github page of 
 * the project.

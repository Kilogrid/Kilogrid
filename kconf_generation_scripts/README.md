# How to generate image on the Kilogrid

First you have to generate a .png image. I used https://www.pixilart.com/draw to generate it (20 x 40 Pixels). 
Then you have to insert the name of the .png file into `kconf_generation_script.py` and adjust the name what config file should be generated. 
Last you have to adjust the colors and values accoriding to the rest of your implementation (marked with TODO).
